# housing-price-prediction-UK
This project builds an ML model using Random Forest Regressor and LightBGM to estimate property value in the UK given a sample of about 22,000 historical sales.

The result is an R-squared value of 0.75 and an RMSE of £435,140.

Data cleaning was important to reduce model bias and generate well rounded interpretations.

To view the model formed, use: 
conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm seaborn matplotlib
and run jupyter notebook.
